# alignment-console-errors
This is a project to help people solve common console errors.

## Getting Started with the Project
You can get the project files from GitHub in two ways: either by cloning the repository or by downloading a ZIP file.

## Option 1: Clone the Repository
This is the recommended method if you're comfortable with Git.

Open your terminal or Git Bash.

Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL:

git clone https://github.com/Iskarr/alignment-console-errors.git

This will create a new folder named alignment-console-errors with all the project files inside.

## Option 2: Download the ZIP File
This is a great option if you don't have Git set up.

Go to the GitHub repository page: https://github.com/Iskarr/alignment-console-errors.

Click the green < > Code button.

From the dropdown menu, click "Download ZIP".

Once the file is downloaded, unzip it on your computer.

## Setting Up and Solving the Bugs
Open in Visual Studio Code: Navigate to the unzipped or cloned folder and open it in Visual Studio Code.

Launch with Live Server: In VS Code, find the index.html file, right-click on it, and select "Open with Live Server". This will open the project in your web browser. Make sure you have the Live Server extension installed.

Open the Console: In your web browser, open the developer tools and navigate to the Console tab. You'll see a list of error messages.

Solve the Errors: Go back to VS Code and open the bugs.js file. Your task is to go through the file and fix the errors.

Check Your Progress: As you fix an error and save the bugs.js file, Live Server will automatically reload the page in your browser. Watch the console to see the errors disappear!

# Uploading instructions
Once you've completed all the challenges, feel free to upload this assignment and use the github pages to show your working code, this way we can load up the application and see your resolved code, and it gives you a place to find where you might have solved an error in the past ands what it means if you ever forget.

How to Host a Website on GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a great way to host a static website directly from your GitHub repository. Here are the steps to get your project live on the web.

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository
First, you need to have your website files in a GitHub repository.

If you don't have one yet, go to github.com, sign in, and click the + icon in the top right corner to create a New repository.

Name your repository and make it public.

Upload your project files (like index.html, style.css, and script.js) to this new repository.

## 2. Access GitHub Pages Settings
Once your files are in the repository, you can enable GitHub Pages.

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.

Click on the Settings tab.

In the left-hand menu, click on Pages.

## 3. Configure the Source
This is where you tell GitHub which branch of your repository contains your website files.

Under the Build and deployment section, find the Source dropdown menu.

Select Deploy from a branch.

Another dropdown will appear. Choose the branch where your code is located, which is usually main or master.

If your files are in a specific folder (like a docs folder), you can also choose that from the next dropdown. If your index.html file is in the root of the repository, you can leave it as (root).

Click Save.

## 4. Wait for Deployment
After you've saved the settings, GitHub will start the deployment process.

You'll see a message at the top of the "Pages" section saying that your site is ready to be published.

It may take a few minutes for the site to go live.

Once it's done, you'll see a link to your live website (e.g., https://username.github.io/repository-name).

That's all there is to it! Your website is now live and accessible to anyone with the link. Every time you push new code to the main branch, GitHub Pages will automatically update your site.
